## Causal Analysis of Bias in Cardiovascular Prediction Models

This repository documents the research and experimental notebooks for my Master of Research (MRes) project on **"Causal Analysis of Ethnic Bias in EHR-based Machine Learning Models for Atrial Fibrillation Prediction"** conducted at UCL. 

[Preliminary brief for the project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h9J8RUqvgTgr_NEmLDg2zh0SJjZ40vUO/view?usp=sharing)

This repository focuses on testing the methodology for the initial stages of the project. Experiments will involve the validation and extension of existing bias assessment and mitigation techniques on open datasets, to prepare a  pipeline that will be tested on the UK Biobank dataset.

## Core Research Questions

1.  **RQ1 (Disparity):** What predictive performance disparities do state-of-the-art ML models for AF incidence trained on structured EHR data exhibit when predictive accuracy is stratified by ethnic subgroups?

2.  **RQ2 (Causality):** How can causal analysis methods be used to identify and explain the unfair pathways that lead to inequitable prediction accuracies?

3. **RQ3 (Mitigation):** What targeted mitigation strategies can be proposed to address the specific pathways of bias and improve the model’s equity?
